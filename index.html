<h2>EDUCATION</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>University of Texas at Arlington</h3>            
<p>Masters of Science - Computer Science; GPA:3.5</p>
<p>Courses:Design and Analysis of Algorithms,Machine Learning,Data Mining,Cloud Computing and Big data,Database Systems,Data Analytics and Modeling techniques,Artificial Intelligence,Python,Computer Networks.</p>
<h3>Vignan's Institute of Information Technology</h3>
<p>Bachelor of Technology - Electronics and Communication Engineering</p>
<h2>EXPERIENCE</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>Software Engineer:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Initially worked in for AT&T in production environment for OCE (Order Capture Engine) Application which deals with order processing which are placed by customer. We check the flow is maintained accurately order are getting processed.</li>
<li>Macmillan Project which is based on AWS cloud Platform on DevOps. AWS Cloud Platform is used to manage the infrastructure of all the applications. It supports various applications like Launchpad, HMN, and Sapling and Flip it. Activities which are performed on AWS cloud includes Manage/launch ec2 Servers(windows/Linux), Managing S3 storage, CloudFront, Server maintenance, Application troubleshot in case of any issues by doing necessary changes in scripts and trying to run jobs on Docker image in Jenkins’s tool</li>
</ul>
<h2>PROJECTS</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Real time object detection using YOLO Algorithm</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Detection of people from video input using the state-of-the-art YOLOv5 (You only look once) method, calculated the Euclidian distance between their centroids and indicated whether they were at a safe distance from each other ,using  Coco128  Dataset. It contains 118k train Images with certain classes shown in picture.</li></p>
</ul>
<h3>Design and Implement a Database Application</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>At first designed an ER/EER schema diagram and then mapped the EER schema into a relational database schema to implement it on ORACLE and finally uploaded data into the database creating some queries and updating transactions.</li></p>
</ul>
<h3>Design a Program for Informed and Uninformed search Strategies based on Heuristic</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Implemented a Python Program to find route between the origin city and destination city will print length of route, list of cities in that route, nodes expanded and generated, where uninformed search is performed heuristic is not provided and informed search when heuristic is provided informed search is performed.</li></p>
</ul>
<h3>Implemented Programs in Big Data using various Programming </h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Implemented MapReduce Program on Hadoop, Spark Program, Pig Program, Spark SQL Program, Pregel on GraphX program and executed all the programs in Expanse (which is a cloud platform).</li></p>
</ul>
<h3>Design and Simulation of T-Shaped Rectangular Microstrip Patch Antenna and Comparison with Double T-Shaped using CST</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Designing a T –Shaped and Double T-Shaped Microstrip patch Antennas. These Designs are Simulated Using CST, based on the Results like Gain, Directivity, Realized Gain Comparison between both Antenna is Achieved.</li></p>
</ul>
<h3>Automatic Dusk to Dawn</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Design a system where light will remain on only from dusk to dawn based on an LDR it senses the change in intensity of light and its output changes accordingly. The output of the LDR is fed to a 555 timer in astable mode, which switches on light during dusk and switches on light during dusk and switches off at dawn.</li></p>
</ul>
<h2>TECHNICAL SKILLS</h2>
